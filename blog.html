<section id="introduction" class="level2" data-number="1">
<h2 data-number="1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>In our <a href="https://urban-institute.medium.com/how-web-scraping-powered-our-analysis-of-work-based-learning-opportunities-in-community-colleges-3452320dc345">previous post</a> we explored how we gathered course descriptions from community colleges in Florida using web scraping techniques. Work-based learning (WBL), which consists of opportunities such as internships, apprenticeships, and practicums, focuses on career preparation and training in supervised, work-like settings. Community colleges, with their career-focused curricula and diverse student populations, offer an ideal setting for such opportunities. We successfully compiled a comprehensive dataset of course descriptions, but the question remained: what is the prevalence and nature of WBL opportunities in Florida’s community colleges as reflected in their course descriptions?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we turned to text analysis, a methodology that allows us to extract meaningful information from large volumes of text data. Text analysis is particularly suited to our research question because it enables us to identify and quantify specific keywords, such as terms related to work-based learning, within our data frame of course descriptions. In this post, we’ll delve into our methodology for analyzing this data using the <code>quanteda</code> package in R, a powerful tool for quantitative text analysis.</p>
</section>
<section id="getting-started-with-quanteda" class="level2" data-number="2">
<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started-with-quanteda"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Getting Started with Quanteda</h2>
<p><a href="https://quanteda.io">Quanteda</a>, short for Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data, is a powerful tool for managing and analyzing text data in R. It offers a suite of functions for managing a <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/corpus/corpus/">corpus</a>—or a collection of texts—such as creating <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/dfm/">document-feature matrices</a>, <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io/basic-operations/tokens/kwic/">analyzing keywords</a>, and more. These functions are highly efficient and provide a consistent interface with support for multiple languages. While it operates as a standalone package, it also integrates seamlessly with extensions such as <code>readtext</code>, <code>spacyr</code>, and <code>quanteda.textstats</code>.</p>
<p>To install and load the required packages, we can use the librarian package for convenience</p>

</div>
<p>Next, we load our text data containing course descriptions as well as document-level metadata using the <code>readtext::readtext()</code> function. We then perform some additional cleaning steps to standardize variable names and focus our analysis on active courses for credit. Here’s a brief explanation of each column in our courses dataframe:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>doc_id: This is a unique identifier for each course. It is constructed by combining the school abbreviation, the course prefix, and the course number. For example, ‘BC-THE-2300’ refers to a course at the school abbreviated as ‘BC’, with the course prefix ‘THE’, and the course number ‘2300’.</p></li>
<li><p>discipline: This column contains the discipline or subject area of the course. The discipline is represented as a code and a description, such as ‘080 - THEATRE ARTS’.</p></li>
<li><p>course_title: This is the title of the course.</p></li>
<li><p>course_credits: This column indicates the number of credit hours that a student receives upon completion of the course.</p></li>
<li><p>text: This column contains the course description text that was scraped from the <a href="https://flscns.fldoe.org/Default.aspx">Florida Department of Education’s course catalog website</a>. This is the main body of text that will be analyzed using text mining techniques. The text appears to be truncated in the provided data, as indicated by the ellipsis at the end of each string.</p></li>

<p>The first step in our analysis is to create a corpus, a collection of text documents, from our course descriptions. We can achieve this using the <code>corpus()</code> function in <code>quanteda.</code> Next, we extract the tokens in the corpus—usually words, but they can also be n-grams or multi-word expressions. The tokens function allows us to define what we mean by tokens and apply some rules to ignore elements such as punctuation and digits.</p>

<p>The output of this code is a corpus object that consists of the course descriptions from our data frame. Each document in the corpus corresponds to a course description, and the corpus contains metadata about each document. For instance, the first few documents in the corpus look something like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Corpus consisting of 3 documents and 3 docvars.

BC-LEI-1700 :

</div>
</div>
<p>Each line represents a document in the corpus, with the document ID (e.g., “BC-THE-2300”) followed by a snippet of the course description. This corpus will serve as the basis for our subsequent text analysis.</p>
<p>After tokenizing the corpus, we obtain a list of tokens for each document. These tokens are essentially the individual words from each course description, stripped of punctuation and numbers.</p>

<h2 data-number="3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-term-searches-with-a-dictionary"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Key-Term Searches with a Dictionary</h2>
<p>Our primary interest lies in identifying courses related to different types of WBL such as internships, apprenticeships, or practicums. To do this, we developed a dictionary of key terms in collaboration with subject matter experts from <a href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/income-and-benefits-policy-center">Urban’s Income and Benefits Policy Center</a> who specialize in workforce development research. Therefore, the dictionary used in this analysis is a product of careful curation based on the literature on WBL.</p>
<p>For each type of WBL experience, we created a list of terms that we want to treat equivalently. This approach allows us to capture the various ways in which a particular type of WBL might be referred to in a course description. For instance, our dictionary specifies that a course description refers to a clinical WBL experience if either of the terms “clinicals” or “clinical experience” appear. This method ensures that our analysis is comprehensive and accurately reflects the range of WBL opportunities offered by community colleges.</p>

<p>Equipped with our dictionary, we’re ready to search for the terms using the <code>kwic()</code> (key-word in context) function. This function takes in a corpus and a dictionary as inputs, along with a window parameter specifying the number of tokens before and after a keyword that we want to see for context. The output of this function is a data frame that provides the matching keyword along with its surrounding context in the <code>pre</code> and <code>post</code> columns, allowing us to understand the use of our key terms within the course descriptions.</p>

<p>Finally, we can merge the results from the dictionary-based keyword in-context search back into our course-level data. This involves joining the keyword data with the original course data, followed by a series of data transformations. First, we split the <code>docname</code> document identifier column into separate <code>school</code> and <code>course</code> columns, which allows us to analyze the frequencies of WBL opportunities by school. Next, we construct a <code>sentence</code> column that encapsulates the matching keywords along with their context, and we format this text to ensure it is in sentence case. Lastly, we carry out a few more string manipulation steps on the <code>discipline</code> and <code>pattern</code> columns to enhance the readability of our data. It’s also worth noting that the <code>pattern</code> column refers to the umbrella term used to describe the same type of WBL opportunity in our dictionary.</p>

<p>Having identified the keywords in the course descriptions, we now turn our attention to quantifying the prevalence of different types of WBL opportunities across schools. To do this, we group our data by school and pattern (which represents the type of WBL opportunity), count the number of occurrences, and then reshape our data so that each type of WBL opportunity becomes a separate column. We also add a ‘total’ row that sums up the counts across all schools for each type of opportunity.</p>

<p>Our text analysis has provided valuable insights into the prevalence of WBL opportunities in Florida’s community colleges. The medical and education sectors dominate WBL opportunities, with clinicals and field experiences being the most common types. However, apprenticeships, despite their proven value in career preparation and advancement, are one of the least offered forms of WBL.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed that the medical and education sectors dominate WBL opportunities, which is expected given that these fields often require practical experience for licensure. Clinicals, largely offered in medical and related fields, and field experiences, predominantly in the education sector, were the most common types of WBL identified. However, we also found that apprenticeships, despite their value in career preparation and advancement (<a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/beyond-productivity-how-employers-gain-more-apprenticeship">Kuehn, Marotta, et al.&nbsp;2022</a>), are one of the least offered forms of WBL.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that our methodology has limitations. For instance, our current dataset lacks information on the quality of WBL experiences and dimensions of equity, such as whether the programs are paid. This is a significant consideration since many community college students work while enrolled in their courses and may not be able to devote time to an unpaid internship or other WBL program.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this exploratory analysis provides a starting point for understanding the prevalence of WBL in community colleges and identifying opportunities for expansion. Future research could build on this work to develop more robust measures of WBL prevalence and to investigate the quality and equity of these opportunities.</p>

<h2 data-number="5" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this post, we’ve demonstrated how to use <code>quanteda</code> to analyze course descriptions and identify WBL opportunities in community colleges. While our analysis focused on Florida, the same methods could be applied to other states or regions. Extending the analysis to other states would provide a broader understanding of WBL opportunities in community colleges across the U.S., informing policy and identifying areas for expansion. This could help establish goals, support programs, and highlight best practices nationwide.</p>
<p><code>Quanteda</code> stands out for its ability to efficiently handle large volumes of text data and intuitive interface. It provides researchers with the flexibility to shape their analysis according to their specific needs, such as identifying key terms, comparing text documents, or investigating text patterns. Given that our study was exploratory in nature, this flexibility was particularly useful. It allowed us to quickly and efficiently examine novel text-data, making <code>quanteda</code> an excellent choice for text analysis. It is important to note that the functions used in this analysis only scratch the surface of the full functionality of <code>quanteda</code>. To learn more, you can read <code>quanteda</code>’s excellent <a href="https://tutorials.quanteda.io">official tutorial</a> and <a href="https://quanteda.io">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Through this analysis, we’ve gained valuable insights into the prevalence of WBL in Florida’s community colleges. We hope that our work can serve as a foundation for further research and policy discussions on this important topic.</p>
